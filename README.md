# google-homepage

TOP's first project. Just make a clone of google's homepage, without the functions. I have already finished FCC's tutorials on HTML and CSS, this will put the skills. I learned there to use!

After notes:
I learned a lot about how to do things that I would not do again. I did not read any of the hints, I just went straight into making it. For example, next time I will make a nav bar instead of doing what I did. Also I learned how to position things correctly using HTMl/CSS. Hopefully as I keep doing this I learn the better standards on how to use HTML/CSS. 

Here is what the clone looks like!
